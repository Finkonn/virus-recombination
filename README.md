# Analysis of natural recombination of Foot-and-mouth disease virus

The purpose of the work is to analyze natural recombination in the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV, genus Aphthovirus), test the hypothesis that there is reproductive isolation between groups of FMDV serotypes, and analyze the temporal dynamics of recombination.
